The Glitch Biome Bot Application is a user-friendly tool designed to monitor the #biome channel in the Sol's RNG discord server. It will catch the  private server links that mention glitch biomes. The application helps users automatically detect and share these links to a target channel via a webhook.

Getting Started
When you first open the application, you will see a simple interface that asks for two key pieces of information:

Discord Token: This is a unique key that allows the bot to access your Discord account and monitor the necessary channel.
Webhook URL: This is the URL of the webhook where detected links will be sent.

Before entering any information, you will see a disclaimer pop-up. Please read it carefully to understand that your data is safe and secure. The disclaimer also includes a button to contact support through a dedicated Discord server if you have any questions or concerns.

NOTE: YOU NEED PYTHON FOR THIS TO WORK!!!
